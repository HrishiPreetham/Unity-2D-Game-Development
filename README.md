This repository contains all the necessary assets which were used in the implementation of my first game "Terrors Of The Dark" . The assets folder include the sprites,C# scripts,animator controllers(which are set according to the requirement of my game) and also prefabs(which are basically the characters which are replicated so that accidental deletion of the character or sprite should not cause us any problem due to the presence of the prefab). This is a simple 2-D game which is developed using the Unity Hub. This being my first game,I have started off with a pretty basic game where a character has to dodge the monsters which are randomly spawned either from the left or right . The user is given a choice to choose from one among the 2 characters available at the start of the game. In order to run my scripts and use the assets it is essential that you download Unity from their official website. (NOTE: The C# source codes are in the scripts folder in assets)
